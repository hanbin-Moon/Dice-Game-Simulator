### Dice-Game-Simulator

A simulator for the dice game played in Runescape (years ago).  

Players bet game money against another rich player, whom acts as the house.

### How does it work?

Game format is decided on, as per what amount of payback, and what odds of winning. Each turn, the player can bet any amount they want.  

You need only specify prize factor (Player wins 2xBet) and chance of winning (45%)
